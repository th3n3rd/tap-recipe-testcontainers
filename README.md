# TAP recipe: Leverage Testcontainers in a test pipeline

This repository is used as a playground to experiment with Tanzu Application Platform (TAP) and
[Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/).

## TODO

[x] Setup a basic workload
[x] Install the OOTB supply chain that support Testing and provide a simple test pipeline
[x] Integrate and test the consumer with a provider stub
[x] Add an acceptance test that leverages testcontainers but exclude it from the test pipeline
[x] Update the test pipeline to support running the acceptance test
